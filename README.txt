1.for the adult_income notebook, we can select the number of training example using sample_size, also, for my expriment of dropping feature, we can uncomment the line for dropping the "fnlwgt" column

2.for the MINST nodebook, just change the number_of_instance parameter. There are two cells for the PCA step for testing my hypothesis, those are commented, for replicating the experiment, we need to uncomment those two cells and run all the remaining cells again.

Please install all the packages from the environment.yaml file before running the notebooks.
